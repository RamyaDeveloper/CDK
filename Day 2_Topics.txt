DAY2

*Pointer   - Variable to store address of another variable
*Declare   - * is placed infront of name associated with its datatype
*Intialize - Assigning address of variable of same datatype

*Function definitions - Body of it along with method signature(declaration)
*Invocation -Call 

*Pass by value     - A copy of variable is created i.e two independent variables with same values
*Pass by reference - Orginal address of variable in memory is passed

*Dynamic memory allocation(DMA) - Managing system memory at runtime
*Deallocation - To free RAM when process is finished

*Memory leakage - When not needed also still if memory is released

*User Defined Structures(UDS) - Structure with set of fields defined by User

*Access data member - Depends on access modifiers like public,private,default and protected

*DMA for UDS - Based upon sizeof UDS ,DMA allocates memory at run time

*Array of pointers - array of variables pointing to the other variables

*Iterate on array of Pointers -Based on datatype, iterator element  is incremented by that no. of bytes
