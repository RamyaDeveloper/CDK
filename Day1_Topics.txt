DAY 1
*Source code - General Understandable code by human
*Object code - Machine understandable code(0s and 1s)

*Using compilers with flags-Some falgs help in fast execution,optimization of code

*Keywords-  Pre-defined words for performing specific function
*Variables- Storage place to store different types of data

*Variable scope - Until which part variables can be accessed
*Lifetime    -    Time until it stays in memory location
*Intial_Value -   Which is made at once in compile time
*Modifiers-		  Prefixed with datatypes which helps in reducing storage place and type of integers

*Selection Programming Constructs - To choose based on condition like if else
*Loop construts  -To execute section of code multiple times 
					*Definite  -count controlled
					*Indefinite-condition controlled
					
*Declare Array    -Giving the datatype to array
*Store data       -Assigning values to array
*Process elements -Indexing the elements will do
